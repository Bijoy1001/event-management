 1. Answer: B
Explanation: There is a typo in the code (greetign instead of greeting). As a result, a ReferenceError will be thrown, indicating that greetign is not defined.

 2. Answer: D
Explanation: JavaScript performs type coercion when using the + operator. In the sum function, the number 1 is added to the string "2", resulting in the concatenation of the two values and producing the string "12".

 3. Answer: A
Explanation: The info.favoriteFood is initially assigned the value at index 0 of the food array ("🍕"). Later, it is reassigned the value "🍝". However, this does not modify the original food array, so console.log(food) will output the original array ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].

 4. Answer: B
Explanation: The sayHi function expects a name parameter, but when called without an argument (sayHi()), name becomes undefined. The returned string will be "Hi there, undefined."

 5. Answer: A
Explanation: The forEach loop iterates over each element in the nums array. The condition if (num) evaluates to true for all elements except 0, so only one iteration (where num is 1) increments the count. Therefore, console.log(count) will output 1.
